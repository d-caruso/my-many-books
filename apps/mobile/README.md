## Architecture

The mobile app follows a component-based architecture with:

- **Expo Router** for navigation

- **AsyncStorage** for local data persistence
- **Shared libraries** for business logic and API integration

## API Integration

The mobile app integrates with the My Many Books API through shared libraries:

- `@my-many-books/shared-api` - API client
- `@my-many-books/shared-types` - TypeScript types
- `@my-many-books/shared-utils` - Utility functions
- `@my-many-books/shared-business` - Business logic
